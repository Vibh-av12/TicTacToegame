# TicTacToegame
This is a tic tac toe game
This rendition of the classic TIC TAC TOE game is implemented using Python, leveraging the tkinter library to create a user-friendly GUI. The game consists of a 3x3 grid of buttons, each representing a cell on the TIC TAC TOE board. Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their markers ('X' or 'O').  The game logic is seamlessly integrated with the GUI, automatically updating the game state and checking for a winner or a draw after each move. The buttons are visually styled for an engaging and intuitive user experience. Players are informed of the game's progress and outcome in real-time, making it both an enjoyable and visually appealing experience.
